### skills

**Project Management** 

- I take the project specifications and information we are provided and we are able to build websites and online marketing campaigns.
- I work with clients who are too busy to answer questions and make do with the limited information that we have and make it work somehow.
- I work with an international team and many of our team members don’t speak English as a first language so I have to be very specific with the way I communicate and provide visual representations of the instructions like screenshots and video.

Projects I’ve handled include:

- Web design and Development
- Multimedia production and post production
- Digital Assets translation
- Systems integration
- Day to day operations support
- Customer service and tech support 

**Quality Assurance**

I have an eye for detail and I inspect websites, apps, content or whatever output the client needs accomplished and I coordinate the corrections with the development or technical team and I am often involved in the troubleshooting process.

**Communications Management**

- I can streamline your communication by becoming the primary point of contact for all your internal and external communication.
- I possess native level English skills for speaking, writing and listening.
- I am familiar with several CRM systems and have experience with basic CRM related tasks.

**Virtual Assistant**

- I can login and pilot your key accounts so you no longer need to login yourself.
- I can take charge and cover data entry, scheduling, reminders, emails, and management or any task that you would prefer to not do yourself.
- I can also help with basic marketing and technical tasks as well as other random tasks.

**Writer:**

- I am an experienced writer so I am confident that I will be able to convey clear instructions to the team and use screenshots and screencasts whenever necessary. 
- My writing skills have been useful in maximizing the output of technical teams who have members with limited communication skills.
