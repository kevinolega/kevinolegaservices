I coordinate the corrections with the development or technical team and I am often involved in the troubleshooting process.

**COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT**

- I can streamline your communication by becoming the primary point of contact for all your internal and external communication.
- I possess native level English skills for speaking, writing and listening.
- I am familiar with several CRM systems and have experience with basic CRM related tasks.

**VIRTUAL ASSISTANT**

- I can login and pilot your key accounts so you no longer need to login yourself.
- I can take charge and cover data entry, scheduling, reminders, emails, and management or any task that you would prefer to not do yourself.
- I can also help with basic marketing and technical tasks as well as other random tasks.
