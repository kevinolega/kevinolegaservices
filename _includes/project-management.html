<!-- Project Managmennt Summary -->
<p><strong>PROJECT MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
<p>I manage projects from planning to completion, ensuring that the client's goals are met in the end.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I receive project specifications and information from clients to build websites, apps, and online marketing campaigns.</li>
	<li>I work with clients who are too overwhelmed to make decisions and too busy to answer questions. I make do with the limited information that we have and make it work somehow.</li>
	<li>I work with an international team and many of our team members don’t speak English as a first language. I'm very specific with the way I communicate and provide visual representations of the instructions like screenshots and video.</li>
</ul>
