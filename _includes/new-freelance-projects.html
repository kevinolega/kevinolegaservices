<h3>NEW PROJECTS</h3>
<p>I recommend that we begin with a small test task when we work on a new project.</p>
<p>You can then proceed to hire me for more small assignments if you are satisfied with my work.</p>
<p>We can expand the scope of my agreement if you are satisfied with my work.</p>
<p>I propose that we begin with a range of 5-10 hours a week so you can try my services <strong>risk-free</strong>.</p>
