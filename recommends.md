People ask me a lot of questions about my recommendations.

So I'm compiling everything here.

Here are the best that I've found and have used extensively. 

_Note: This list is not complete nor permanent. I adjust this list from time to time._

#### Current:

**Current book I'm reading:** 

The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to follow the Bible as Literally as Possible by A. J. Jacobs

**Playlist:** 

- Upon Wakeup, [this is what I play in the morning.][1]
- When working, I listen to [Tycho's Dive][2].

**Exploring:**

Stoicism and Alan Watts.

**Meditation Apps:**

Headspace,  Buddhify, 10% Happier, Oak, and Tara Brach Podcast.

**Notes App:** 

Switching from Evernote to Apple Notes

**Preferred Transportation:**

Cycling or Uber. Grab has replaced Uber in the Philippines.

**Preferred Journal App:**

Day One and The Bullet Journal but I'm considering moving everything to Google Calendar.

**Preferred Fitness Program:**

CrossFit, but Calisthenics is cool too. The basics is enough though, push-ups, squats, burpees and pull-ups whenever possible. I'll need to get my jump-rope game upgraded.

#### Questions

**What kind of bike do you own?**

I have a folding bike, a mountain bike and a fixed gear bike. 

The folding bike is my errand bike because it has a rear carrier.

My mountain bike is a comfortable short distance bike.

My fixed gear bike is my long distance race bike.

#### TV Shows

- **Lost in Space**. If you liked the movie you'll love this expanded ten episode series.
- **Bojack Horseman**. Philosphical and funny.
- **Love Live: School Idol Project**. Inspirational, lots of stuff about Japanese culture and work ethic.

#### Manga
**Berserk**. A dark fantasy that follows the story of Guts, the black swordsman.
