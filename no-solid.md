I understand that saying "no" now is a thousand times better than making you wait because of indecision.

I also understand that saying "no" now is a hundred times better than a reluctant "yes."

I know from experience that a reluctant yes has made my life a living hell.

I'm confident that you have a similar experience.

I'm saying no to almost everything.

I'm committed to [what I'm doing now](https://kevinolega.com/now).

Then again, a no is not a never.

I really appreciate the offer and you thinking of me.

I appreciate the effort that you reached out.

If you get back to me in six months to a year maybe my situation has changed.
