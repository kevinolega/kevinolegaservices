 <h2 id="customer-service">>Customer Service Agent for Voicemail</h2>
  <p>I need someone to handle a client's customer service calls.</p>
  <p>The client is involved in real estate investments and has online training courses and consulting services.</p>
  <p>There's a vast amount of things that one needs to know to represent us well, but there's not enough volume of calls to put together a detailed manual.</p>
  <p>Here's what we have so far.</p>

  <h3>Nature of the task:</h3>
  <p>The client has several voicemails. The customer service agent calls the voicemail, clarifies and documents the concern, then follows up with an email from Sean/Kevin or a callback from Sean.</p>
  <p>Sean operates 8 am to 6 pm Eastern Standard Time. I still need to clarify when Sean is available to call.</p>

  <h3>Tools:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>RingCentral</strong> will be used to check voicemails and to call the clients.</li>
    <li><strong>Asana</strong> will be used to document the calls and next actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Slack</strong> will be used for internal communications.</li>
    <li><em>Later: <strong>Calendly</strong> will be used to schedule Sean's calls.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>About the Agent:</h3>
  
  <h4>Professional</h4>
  <p>Sound polite during conversations. You'd occasionally encounter rude calls. Maintain.</p>

  <h4>Friendly and Helpful</h4>
  <p>Your goal is to help callers find solutions to their problems. Always remind yourself and the client of that fact.</p>

  <h4>Communication Skills</h4>
  <p>Always articulate your responses clearly and listen attentively. Given the lack of a comprehensive manual, comprehension and effective communication are key.</p>

  <h4>Listen Actively:</h4>
  <p>While the script provides direction, the assistant should be trained to actively listen. This might mean occasionally diverting from the script if the client's response doesn't align with the next script question.</p>


  <h3>Script Follows:</h3>
  <h4>Part 1: Greeting</h4>
  <p>Hello, is this [Client Name]? My name is [Agent Name] and I'm calling from the office of Sean Flanagan.</p>

  <h4>Part 2: Purpose Clarification</h4>
  <p><!-- ... --></p>


  <h3>Post-Call Actions:</h3>
  <h4>Documentation:</h4>
  <p>"After every call, immediately document the discussion in Asana, noting down key points, concerns raised, and any follow-up actions required."</p>

  <h4>Follow-Up:</h4>
  <p>"Ensure a timely follow-up based on the discussed action items. Whether it's an email from Sean/Kevin or a callback, make sure the client's concerns are addressed promptly."</p>

  <h3>How to Handle Different Situations</h3>
  <h4>When the client asks a question that you don't have the answer to:</h4>
  <p>"I appreciate your detailed question. While I have a general understanding of our offerings and processes

  <h4>If a client is particularly upset or frustrated:</h4>
  <p>"I genuinely apologize for any inconvenience or confusion you've experienced. I want to make sure we resolve this for you. Let's go over the details, and I'll ensure your feedback is pr​​ioritized."</p>

  <h4>For repeated concerns or inquiries from the same client:</h4>
  <p>"I recognize that you've reached out about this before. I apologize for any oversight or delay. Let's discuss the best way forward and ensure we address this matter fully this time."</p>

  <h4>When the client inquires about non-listed services or advanced features:</h4>
  <p>"Thank you for your interest. While I'm not currently aware of that specific feature/service, I'll make a note and ensure Sean is informed. We're always looking to meet our client's needs, and your feedback is invaluable."</p>

  <h4>In case of technical issues during the call:</h4>
  <p>"I apologize for the inconvenience, it seems we're experiencing some technical difficulties. Can I arrange a callback or would you prefer to communicate through email for now?"</p>

  <h4>When a client is indecisive or unsure about what they need:</h4>
  <p>"I understand that this can be a bit overwhelming. How about we start with what you know or any particular goals you have in mind? This can help guide our conversation and ensure you get the most out of our services."</p>

  <h4>For queries about pricing or offers:</h4>
  <p>"I can provide you with general information about our pricing structure. For specific offers or customized packages, Sean would be the best person to discuss this with. I'll ensure he's made aware of your interest."</p>

  <h4>Handling missed or rescheduled appointments:</h4>
  <p>"I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the missed or rescheduled appointment. Let's work together to find a suitable time slot. We appreciate your understanding and patience."</p>
