I've taken the Big 5 personality test.

Some free versions call this the OCEAN test.

Here are my results.

Openness 61

Conscientiousness 45

Extraversion 40

Agreeableness 50

Neuroticism 87

Here's the [link to the free version of the test]

I've taken Jordan Peterson's premium personality test.

The test covers a more comprehensive reading of your scores.
