### PROJECT MANAGEMENT WORK

I make my living helping entrepreneurs implement their business ideas by working as their digital project manager, overseeing the creation and development of websites, apps, and digital marketing campaigns. 

My role includes optimizing email newsletters, social media, and video services to grow audiences.

I also conduct SEO keyword research, and planning and creating content to enhance search engine rankings.

* I enable entrepreneurs and digital nomads to run their business from their preferred chat app and offload repetitive, time consuming tasks.
* I manage customer service teams, assign tasks to freelancers, manage transactions, do research, represent my clients to their clients, and many more.
* I help my clients document processes and create systems that enable us to eliminate, automate and delegate time consuming tasks to slowly but surely liberate them from being chained to the laptop from 9-5 or working sixteen hour days. 

### FREELANCE WORK

* I worked as a Junior Project Manager and virtual assistant for DG Consulting, an IT consulting firm for eight-figure entrepreneurs and online marketers.
* I processed various paperwork for local business clients.

### ONLINE WRITING

**Minimal Changes Blog:** In 2010, I started a website titled [minimal changes](http://minimalchanges.com) about my personal experiments to develop free time, spare cash, a clear head and lighter living by applying minimalist lifestyle expriments and by testing counter intuitive strategies on myself. It's been a fun ride.

**Philippine Island Living Blog:** I'm from the Philippines and I enjoy travel and trying out food. Occassionaly, I take lots of pictures. I started a website named [Philippine Island Living](http://philippineislandliving.com) to share tips and stories about my adventures and the things I enjoy about life in the Philippines. I eventually rebranded the website in 2020 to help promote local businesses and service providers.

**Call Center Training Tips:** I worked in the BPO industry since 2007 my friends have been asking me for tips on how to get hired in a call center. I'm an introvert. People who know me growing up know it that's why they ask me for tips because they couldn't believe the improvement. I enjoy teaching people because I know the challenges of people who are shy or have difficulty communiting. I enjoy helping shy people like me. Over time I realized that I've been spending a bit too much time doing this so I decided to set up a website and write all my lessons instead of spending a few hours with them teaching them all I know over beer or food.
