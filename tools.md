As for my current work set-up, I am using an updated MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iPhone, and Android for work and will be able to assist your team using these systems. 

[Here is a screenshot of the specifications of my work computer]({{ site.url }}/img/MB-Pro-2015.png).

I can configure my system to run on triple monitor and increase my internet connection to match your required specifications. 

If you require a specific tool or software that I failed to include in my message, I can learn and master said tool within a day or two.
