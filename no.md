I'm saying no to most invitations and opportunities.

I do not have the resources nor the mental bandwidth to particpate or "try" something else.

I'm aware that I have limited time and resources to accomplish the most important projects that I need to accomplish.

I'm also aware that I have exactly enough to accomplish what I need to accomplish.

That being said, I don't need "more" of whatever you're offering.

I have enough.

I'm working on accomplishing a specific goal.

I'm committed to a very specific plan of action.

I don't even have time to check if your specific proposal fits into my long-term strategy in any way.

I already know what I need to do.

I'm doing it right now. 

So I'm saying no to almost everything.

Then again, a no is not a never.

I really appreciate the offer and you thinking of me.

I appreciate the effort that you reached out.

If you get back to me in six months to a year maybe my situation has changed.
