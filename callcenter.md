Call Center Training Tips
=========================

About the project:
------------------

I'm a shy person by nature.

In 2005 I attempted to get a job in a call center and failed.

My dad told me that I'm doomed and my mom told me that I should get a low paying job.

Fearing a life of low paying jobs, I refused to give up and committed to learn.

I took notes, lots of notes.

After months of trial and error, learning techniques to overcome my shyness, interviewing others, I eventually got my first job offer.

I tried a couple of other companies and got job offers as well. I finally, understood the secrets of how to get job offer in a call center.

I shared my notes with three of my friends and all of them got hired in a call center.

I shared my notes with an entrepreneur and it was used as a basis to write a call center training program and start a call center training school. I also became an assistant to said entrepreneur and played multiple roles from staff to teacher to recruiter and eventually, an officer for the call center as our operations grew.

In the process we helped a few thousand people land call center jobs. Notable accomplishments were assisting students who were experiencing various challenges in getting an employment in a call center.

*   Some students have limited education: Didn't finish college or only finished high school.
*   Some had no confidence and felt they were only entitled to low paying jobs: Trycicle Drivers, Taxi Drivers, Store Sales Clerks, etc.
*   Some were retirees who were looking for an income source.
*   Some where full time moms who wanted to assist the family income stream.
*   Some were people who simply didn't have confidence.

Over time as people asked for my help, I spent a lot of drinking sessions coaching strangers on how to get hired in a call center.

To decrease the time I spend coaching and extend my help to others, I encoded my notes into a website and eventually, wrote a book on the topic.

My efforts resulted in:

*   a website with 3,000 monthly visitors.
*   A facebook page with 16,400 followers.
*   An email list with a thousand subscribers.
*   Hundreds of heartfelt emails and messages from the people I've inspired.

The website is currently down because I'm migrating out of Wordpress. Let me know if you need help and I'll send you some articles.
