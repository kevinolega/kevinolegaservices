### work

I do project management work for a US based web design firm.

I enable entrepreneurs to cut their work hours, by offloading their repetitive and time consuming tasks and personally managing their business and personal projects.

I write articles for different fitness, productivity, education, financial and creativity blogs.

I'm currently not accepting work and business proposals. [Here's a picture of what my task list looks like right now.][1]
