Here's what I'm doing now.

### work

I manage projects for a US-based web design and development company.

I also manage marketing projects for a career and HR consulting business.

I'm processing different paperwork for local business clients.

[I'm not accepting additional work and business proposals](https://kevinolega.com/n/).

I am grateful I get to work from home. 

I operate from Parañaque City.

### projects

I'm editing the final 150 pages of [my second book](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/books).

I sell [English lessons](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/promos/) and write [career advice for BPO workers][1] as part of my community service.

I rarely leave home and say [no to all invitations and requests](https://olega.org/n).

I just purchased [olega.org](https://olega.org/) for my homepage. 

I'm migrating all my pages and links into the new url.

### fitness

Since the Covid-19 lockdown I've been doing [Tabata exercises](https://minimalchanges.com/tabata) at 60-70% of my capacity for about 30 minutes to develop my exercise consistency.

I purchased a barbell and squat rack so I follow a 5 x 5 protocol for presses, squats and deadlifts.

I'd like to box and try Jiujitsu after the pandemic.

### personal

[My dog][4] is [now a father](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gpVKEn4ZS/) and I'm now caring two pets as part of my schedule.

I am taking care of [Missy](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNIfQyrH9lS/?igshid=nsyvxrtdc45w), my friend's dog.

I'm renting a small apartment that doubles as an office and exercise space.

I spend my free time [cycling][5], [blogging][7] and [drawing][8].

I avoid consuming carbs, sugar, and eat mostly [beef and eggs][9].

I geek out on anime, manga, and J-pop idols.

[Stay in touch with me by joining my personal mailing list.][10]

My website is the best source of information about me, my work, and what I'm doing. 

I don't post updates about myself on social media.

This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers’ /now page][11] movement. Check it out at [nownownow.com][12].
