**how to reach me:**

The best way to stay in touch is [joining my email list where I send my updates](https://sendfox.com/kevinolega).

You can send me an email and tell me what you need and I'll reply when I'm logged in.

If you need to reach me for something urgent, you can send me a text message and I'm going to reply or call you back when I'm available.

Monday to Wednesday is usually crazy busy and Friday is difficult to leave Parañaque. 

That's the reason I do most things online.
