Imagine never having to open your inbox for email, project management, social media or chat app.

No more distractions.

No more interruptions.

You can now focus on the important things.

We helped a client free the first half of his workday so he can spend time with his dog, improving his health and tending to his farm.

We did that by logging into his email, project management tools and business chat applications.

We received instructions from his clients, client's customers and assigned the task to his staff on his behalf.

He does login in the afternoon, to review what happened and to check the output.

With most of the tasks done.

Over time, we ended up writing the reports on the accomlishements of the day, and reported it to the clients and saved him another hour and he can log off at 5pm instead of six pm.

He just sends us a repetitive message that says:

"Good job for today! See you tomorrow!"
