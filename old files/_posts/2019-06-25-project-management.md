It's easy to take on too much and get overwhelmed.

Here are ways that I can help manage your projects.

- I take the project specifications and information we are provided and we are able to build websites and online marketing campaigns.
- I work with clients who are too busy to answer questions and make do with the limited information that we have and make it work somehow.
- I work with an international team and many of our team members don’t speak English as a first language so I have to be very specific with the way I communicate and provide visual representations of the instructions like screenshots and video.

Projects I’ve handled include:

- Web design and Development
- Multimedia production and post production
- Digital Assets translation
- Systems integration
- Day to day operations support
- Customer service and tech support
