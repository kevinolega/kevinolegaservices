### Assistant:

Full-time or part-time (20+ hours/week) administrative assistant for Kevin Olega Services Inc — my “umbrella” company that does everything I do, from online publishing to app development to who-knows-what in the future. So there’s lots of room to learn and grow.

### Where:

Sucat, Parañaque City.

Yes it must be in-person in the office for all working hours. Sorry no work-from-home this time. Please don’t apply unless you live near Sucat (SM BF, Santana Grove Area).

### Description:

I’m looking for an outgoing and empathetic self-starter with an ability to work and learn on his/her own.

This will be fast-paced and dynamic with a wide-range of tasks. It’s administrative to start, but responsibilities will grow over time.

### Responsibilities and Requirements:

- General administrative support

- Data entry, analysis, and research on a wide range of projects
- Make travel arrangements, such as booking flights and making hotel reservations
