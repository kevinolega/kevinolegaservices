You're highly intelligent.

You're creative.

You have average levels of conscientiousness.

Your levels of industriousness is low to average.

One of the biggest problems that you experience is you quickly lose interest in routine work.

You'd like to write new marketing copy.

You'd like to continue building your new product.

You'd like to test your new video concept.

You'd like to build a version 0.001 of the idea that came to you as you woke up (or was in the shower).

You'd like to attend a boxing or BJJ class to work on your technique.

However, you have one big problem.

You still need to clock-in your billable hours.

A good number of your income source involves doing some repetitive work.

You're bored out of your mind.

You find yourself spending more time on social media, Netflix, YouTube, or your favorite game.

You'd like to do the interesting creative tasks that will EXPONENTIALLY grow your business.

But you still have mandatory routine tasks.

You end up wasting time trying to motivate yourself.

This seem to be an endless cycle for me until my client gave me a slap in the face from the other side of the planet that boosted my career.

Hire help.

Get someone to do the simple boring tasks.

Start slow.

Get help for your laundry.

Get help for your food preparation.

Get help for your customer service.

Get help for your emails.

Get help for your research.

Get help for your purchases.

Slowly cut down your boring tasks.

We generally work eight hours a day.

We do four or five tasks in an hour if you're productive.

A task may take ten to fifteen minutes a day.

It's almost impossible to let someone else do your job.

However, it's simple to hand over ten and fifteen minute tasks over.

What would it be like to check your email for five minutes instead of two hours.

What would it be like to never check your email again?

Slowly hand off simple tasks.

Aim to free up one hour.

Then aim to free up two hour.

Make it a goal to go home early on a Friday if you're ambitious.

Make it your next goal to start your Monday with half your work already completed.

Imagine a day when 90% of your day is focused on interesting creative tasks.

You are motivated, productive, and more importantly, excited every single day.

Get help.

There are other intelligent people like you who are excited to work on your mundane problems.

We can setup an infrastructure to help make your life easier.
